# Team Python Fever battling COVID-19 with Machine Learning for Social Good

This project analyzes time series data collected by Rearc and made publicly available on [Amazon Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jmb464qw2yg74?qid=1585594883027&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title). Our data set spans from Februrary 12 to July 26.

The objective of the this project is to predict the daily number of COVID-19 cases in Texas using a long short term memory (LSTM) model to conduct a univariate time series analysis.
